findConsecutiveRuns
===================

Given an array of unsorted positive integers, write a function that finds runs of 3 consecutive numbers (ascending or descending) and returns the indices where such runs begin. If no such runs are found, return null.

Example:  
Array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7] 
Returns: [0, 4, 6, 7]
